# My Portfolio

### Hey, I'm Jenifer!
This is the repo for my Front-end designer portfolio, live at jeniferquelali.com

**About me:**
I'm a brazilian girl that is passionate about drawings, birds and design. I enjoy creating nice and clean layouts, and also dabble in 3D whenever I can.

**Objective:** This portfolio was made to showcase my projects and skills in front-end.
