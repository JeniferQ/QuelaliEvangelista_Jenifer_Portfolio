(10, 'Logo', 'Redesigning the logo was the first step to establish Dr. Nut’s new design identity. Inspired by brands like Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper, the logo was simplified and a sans-serif typeface was implemented. Certain elements were removed, but the nut and text structure remained to preserve the logo’s essence. The red colour, previously only present in packaging, became part of the brand’s primary colours along with white. The final result was a logo that was bold and modern but still felt familiar to Dr. Nut’s audience.', 'media95918.jpg', 'Dr Nut\'s old and new logo', 23),
(11, 'Design Guidelines', 'After the logo was finalized, the next step was to create the full design document of the brand on Adobe XD. The document required information about: the logo, spacing, sizing, typography, photography, iconography, grids. website sections and product cards.\r\n\r\nThe choice of font was based on the typeface of the logo, and chosen colours were based on the logo and nuts of different kinds. The photography style choice was tied to the the brand’s mission and when it came to website sections, the goal was to create clean and easily navigable pages.', 'media24891.jpg', 'Dr Nut design guidelines', 23),
(12, 'Home', 'After the design guidelines were completed, the website was developed using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The homepage was structured for easy navigation, redirecting users to other pages through illustrative banners. Promotional content was featured in the hero banner, guiding users to the products section. A contact information section was also included at the bottom of the page for easy access.', 'media82890.jpg', 'Dr Nut home page', 23),
(13, 'Mission', 'The mission page took a more informative role, giving users a deep understanding of the brand’s values and impact throughout the years. Written data and infographics were combined to effectively showcase the accomplishments of Dr. Nut, and direct links to charity pages affiliated with the brand were provided to encourage users to donate and explore other websites connected to Dr. Nut’s objective.', 'media76704.jpg', 'Dr Nut mission page', 23),
(14, 'Products', 'The products page was mainly an interactive section that displayed a variety of information about the beverages sold by the company. Each product contained ratings, reviews, nutritional facts and a direct link to their purchase page. As the user slides through the different products available, their corresponding information displayed accordingly, allowing users to quickly find the items they are looking for.', 'media42955.jpg', 'Dr Nut almond product page', 23),
(15, 'Promotional Video', 'The last step was to create a video that promoted the company’s products. With the use of Cinema 4D, beverage cans were modelled and animated to slide or float across the screen. The footage was then edited in Premiere Pro, where product qualities were highlighted to encourage viewers to make a purchase. The chosen music reflected the brand’s friendly tone, and the simple visual style ensured that the focus stayed on the products and the information presented.', 'media58172.mp4', 'Dr Nut\'s commercial video', 23),
(16, 'Logo', 'The first step of this project was to create a logo that embodied the brand’s concept of expression and sensuality. After considering several names, Kavorka was chosen for it meaning of attractiveness. Once the brand’s name was decided, my role was to aid and approve my project partner’s logo design. Multiple beauty brands were sources of inspiration for his design, such as Dove and Sephora. The Philosopher font was chosen for its balance of readability and elegance, and the letter “V” was replaced by a pink heart-shaped figure resembling lips. The final result was a sophisticated and feminine logo with an unique design that aligned with Kavorka’s values.', 'media15728.jpg', 'Kavorka white and normal logo', 24),
(17, 'Design Guidelines', 'After the creation of a logo, the next step was to take the brand’s already established concept and create a design guidelines document in collaboration with my project partner. The document reinforced the brand’s values and contained rules for the brand’s logo, colours, typography and photography. Both the colours and font choices were tied to the brand’s core values, while the photography style was meant to be unique and inclusive, ensuring that Kavorka would appeal to a wide and diverse audience.', 'media81884.jpg', 'Kavorka design guidelines', 24),
(18, 'Products', 'Once the design guidelines were completed, three products were created for the brand: a moisturizer, a make-up brush and a lipstick. Those products were chosen because together they offer variety to the brand. The packaging for those products was designed with simplicity and sophistication in mind as they were meant to be recognizable, but not overly flashy. Kavorka’s products were intended to be accessible, and so the packaging design reflected that.', 'media80109.jpg', 'Kavorka make up brush, body cream and lipstick', 24),
(19, 'Advertising Campaign', 'With the products and brand identity in hand, the next step was to design six banners and a magazine spread to promote the brand’s products and website. Both the magazine spread and banners highlighted the positive effects of using Kavorka and emphasized key features of the products, such as vegan ingredients or allergy-free formulas. The majority of them also displayed pictures of young and happy women to convey a positive feeling.\r\nan image ', 'media15632.jpg', 'Kavorka body cream banner', 24),
(20, 'Commercial', 'After the banners were finalized, a short commercial had to be created to promote both the brand and its products. The goal of the video was to showcase Kavorka’s proximity with women and how the brand impacted their lives. During the first part, the video build’s up the viewer’s curiosity, inducing them to question what are the similarities Kavorka has with women. The second half is the answer, highlighting the core features of the brand. The video ends with a display of the products and an animated logo sequence.', 'media92658.mp4', 'Kavorka commercial video', 24),
(21, 'Model', 'Before developing a website, the earbuds model had to be created and animated to provide assets for the project. After researching various earbuds designs, I settled with a circular earbuds shape with long handles. The case design was simple, a clean circular shaped box with soft pads to hold each earbud. Once the concept was defined, the earbuds were modelled in Cinema4D over the course of three days. Different case colours, a transparent earbud view and an animation of the case opening were rendered using Redshift.', 'media42271.jpg', 'Comet earbuds model', 25),
(22, 'Website - Model Viewer', 'Once the earbud assets were finalized, the website was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Model Viewer API. The Model Viewer API added a dynamic section to the page which allowed users to interact with the earbuds model by rotating, zooming and hovering over hotspots to view information. On mobile devices, where this API was not fully supported or did not perform properly, the hotspots and model were presented as static elements. A static image was also displayed when the model viewer failed to load.', 'media18817.jpg', 'Comet model viewer with hotspots', 25),
(23, 'Animation', 'The animation, initially created in Cinema4D, was edited in After Effects and exported as sequence of images. The scroll-driven animation implemented utilized JavaScript to dynamically load and add those images to the page when the user scrolled, creating an animated sequence driven by scrolling. To optimize the website’s performance, all images were converted to WebP format to reduce their size.', 'media25508.jpg', 'Comet animation snippet', 25),
(24, 'Additional features', 'Multiple sliders were added to the page to enable more interactivity for users. Features such as colours and reviews were added as cards inside sliders, while the x-ray view of the earbuds model had it’s own dedicated slider. On mobile devices, where the x-ray view wasn’t the most suitable option, a static image was used instead. The contact form also featured animated rockets, which added some fun and engagement for users.', 'media66201.jpg', 'Comet x-ray vision', 25),
(29, 'bernardo', 'bernardo', 'media57738.jpg', 'bernardo', 25),
(30, 'Research', 'Since the client requested to have arcade elements in the redesign, the first step was researching arcade related UI styles. We also explored who was Max Headroom, as we needed to include references of him in our design. Our team gathered several pixelated, arcade and retro-browser elements in FigJam to assist in the inspiration process. Ultimately, I opted to design a hybrid between modernity and arcade for our UI.', 'media59144.jpg', 'FigJam created for the project', 34),
(31, 'Website', 'With the research step completed, I began the redesign process. The UI was created with user-friendliness in mind, using high contrasts and easily identifiable buttons to help people of all ages navigate the website. The design itself was heavily arcade inspired, incorporating colours and fonts given by the client. Once my design was completed, our team built the website using HTML, CSS, JS and Node. Due to the limitation of having the website accessible only through the arcade machine, a responsive website was not needed. ', 'media82653.jpg', 'Website\'s homepage', 34),
(32, 'Model Integration', 'While designing, we had the challenge of integrating the 3D models into the interface. Since the user had to be able to freely interact with the models, rotating, zooming and moving it, they received a lot of space in the website. The right side of the screen was used to show information, but it could be minimized to allow for even more space for the model objects.  Certain objects had more information than others, so a light box was used to ensure that the layout was never too big to fit the screen.', 'media73413.jpg', 'Object page with live model', 34),
(33, 'Website', 'Since this project was an update of the previous Industry Night page, we used the existing website as a main source of inspiration and incorporated new elements for a fresh experience. Following the college’s design guidelines, we developed a mobile-first responsive website using HTML, CSS and HTML that presented event information in a visually appealing and engaging way. With strategic use of call-to-action statements throughout the website, we actively encouraged users to participate and feel connected to the event.', 'media09830.jpg', 'Website\'s home page', 35),
(34, 'Event Information', 'To integrate the event experience into the website, we designed several elements such as image galleries and informative content boxes and used colours strategically to highlight key details about Industry Night. To add credibility and depth, we also researched and featured past Industry Night partners, setting our project apart from other teams by emphasizing the event’s history and connections.', 'media82468.jpg', 'Event information section', 35),
(35, 'Program and Student Information', 'Finally, sections highlighting both student portfolios and the Interactive Media Design program were incorporated in the website. To ensure equal representation, our team created individual content boxes for each student, giving everyone a dedicated space. For the program itself, we provided information describing the program and its impact on students, and also included some pictures to depict the program to help prospective students understand the nature of it.', 'media90131.jpg', 'Section with student portfolios', 35),
(36, 'Logo', 'The first step of this project was to create a logo. Each member of the team contributed with unique concepts, and the feedback of both our professors and the client helped us select the final design. The chosen logo was a blend of marigold and poppy, symbols that represented Indian and Canadian soldiers respectively. The blend represented their union during the war, and darker tones were used to convey a grounded and respectful tone for them.  Additionally, the logo was designed with versatility in mind, making it suitable for commercial use such as pins and bags.', 'media01289.jpg', 'Brothers in Arms Memorial logo', 36),
(37, 'Design Guidelines', 'Once our logo was created, we moved on to design the project’s brand guidelines. The document contained rules about the brand concept, colours, typography and commercial use.  Our main colours were inspired by the marigold and poppy flowers, complemented by neutral grey tones to create balance and harmony. For typography, we selected a clean sans-serif typeface to convey both modernity and seriousness. In the end, we established a brand identity that respectfully reflected the memorial’s values in a grounded and meaningful way.', 'media81926.jpg', 'Typography page of the BIA brandbook', 36),
(38, 'Website', 'The website for this project was developed using HTML, Sass, JavaScript, Vue, and Lumen. It was designed to establish an emotional connection with users by incorporating powerful imagery and descriptions of the sacrifices made by the soldiers. We showcased their letters and awards to highlight their bravery and courage, creating a meaningful and respectful tribute. A variety of calls to donate were placed throughout the site to encourage donations for the memorial.', 'media57497.jpg', 'Website\'s homepage', 36),
(39, 'Website - About', 'To make users more connected not only to the soldiers but the foundation as well, we created an About page that explained the initiative and its current developments. The page provided information on how the project originated and the progress made so far, helping users understand the purpose and impact of the memorial. By connecting the user to people being honoured and the foundation itself,  we could effectively drive them to donate for the cause', 'media78136.jpg', 'Section explaining the development of the memorial', 36),
(40, 'Website - Donations', 'Our donations page was designed to simplify the donation process and encourage contributions. Users could select from preset amounts or enter a custom donation, with the option to remain anonymous. To promote transparency and build trust, we incorporated a progress bar displaying the total funds raised, along with a donation history showcasing recent contributions. Donations exceeding 2,000 CAD were featured in a dedicated section, providing appreciation for the memorial’s greatest supporters.', 'media71286.jpg', 'Donation section of the page', 36);
